                        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>Transcript+ has the ability to instantly convey your information to employers of a field of your choice. When you share with us some of your information, Transcript+ promises to protect your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines the flow of user information through our website and services, what is saved and why, and your choices pertaining to the information you choose or choose not to use with our services. If there are any questions, please <a href="mailto:">email us!</a></p>
                        <h3>Collection and Use of Information</h3>
                        <p><b>Upon Registration:</b> We take in some basic personal information including a username, your real name, password, and email address. Some of this information, like your real name and email address, are required when you publish or edit a Transcript+, but nothing is displayed publically until that happens.</p>
                        <p><b>Other Information Given To Us:</b>To fully complete your personal Transcript+, you may provide us with other various pieces of personal information including places of education, work experience, phone number, spoken languages, special classes or conferences attended, extracurricular activities, awards and recognitions… the list goes on, and is limited only by what you have accomplished. You will also have the option to upload credentials for these pieces. Again, none of this information is automatically made public. When you publish or edit a Transcript+, the fields you designate to be shown, and the associated credentials, are represented in the Transcript+.</p>
                        <p><b>Who Can See Your Information:</b> With a completed Transcript+, you may either direct employers to its uniquely generated link or print out a copy to take with you, and in either case your entire Transcript+ will be viewable, with the information you decided to place on it. While it is possible for your link to be accessed by someone who happens to use it, our services and link naming algorithm makes this highly unlikely. Users are able to delete Transcript+’s, but it may take up to a week for it to be erased from our servers.</p>
                        <p><b>Information We Gather:</b> Transcript+ logs certain information based on how you use our services. This includes the pages you visit, pageviews on your Transcript+, and statistics based on the information you provide us. This is done so that we can improve Transcript+ as it grows, and for us to learn how to even more effectively convey your information.</p>
                        <h3>Modifications To This Policy</h3>
                        <p>This Privacy Policy may be changed from time to time, but your rights under it will never be reduced without a notification sent out to all users. Any changes will happen on this page, and any significant changes will be accompanied by a similar notification, as mentioned.</p>
